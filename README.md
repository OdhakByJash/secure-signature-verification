# üñäÔ∏è Secure Signature Verification Using Siamese Networks

This repository contains a **signature verification system** using a **Siamese ResNet-based neural network**. The system is trained to distinguish between genuine and forged signatures and can be used to authenticate handwritten signatures across multiple datasets.

---

## ‚åö Workflow

- Preprocessing the images: All signatures are converted to grayscale and resized to a uniform size for consistent input to the network.
- Creating signature pairs: Positive pairs (genuine-genuine) and negative pairs (genuine-forged) are generated to train the model.
- Training a Siamese network: Each branch of the Siamese network uses a ResNet18 backbone to extract embeddings from the signature images. The network learns to minimize the distance between embeddings of genuine pairs and maximize the distance for forged pairs using contrastive loss. 
- Threshold-based verification: During inference, the Euclidean distance between embeddings is compared to a threshold to classify whether a signature pair is genuine or forged.
- Integration: The trained model can be accessed via a Django REST Framework backend and interacted with using a Streamlit interface.
